Spec: Everything here is LE
Magic bytes are 4 bytes (0x3f, 0x45, 0x33, 0x77)

Width (2 bytes, unsigned, LE)

Height (2 bytes, unsigned, LE)

Stride (in bytes, 1 byte, unsigned, LE), can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

Type (1 byte, either 0 for RGBA (isnt float), 1 for RGB (isn't float), 2 for YCbCr (isn't float), 3 for YCbCrA (isn't float), anything above 9 is custom.)

Data (size is width * height * stride, first compressed with RLE8, then LZMA)

RLE: (1 byte for count, another byte for the data)
LZMA: (length of dictionary in 4 bytes, count of elements in dicionary in 4 bytes, count of elements amount of LZMA item, then the LZMA data)

LZMA item: 4 bytes, anything

LZMA data: n LZMA blocks

LZMA block: index of LZMA dictionary/list in 4 bytes unsigned
